* [Language Models](#usage)
  * [Character Based Neural Language Model using LSTM](https://github.com/pseudoPixels/machine_learning_diary/blob/master/notebooks/character_based_neural_language_model/character_based_neural_language_model.ipynb)
     :: This is a character based neural language model. The LSTM model
     is trained using sequences of characters from a data source to predict
     the next possible character in the sequence.
